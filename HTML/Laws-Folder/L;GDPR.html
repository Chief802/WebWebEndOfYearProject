             The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a new EU law that makes it so that companies need to follow certain rules in regards to information they collect.
            Certain types of personal data is not allowed to be collected except on special occasions,
            such as political views, sexual orientation and professional affiliation. Data may only be collected for a specific purpose
             and the user must be informed about exactly why they are saved and how they are stored. 
             Despite this, GDPR defines personal information as any information that can "be bound to and identify a person in life." and that companies only should collect a "reasonable amount of data", which may make things unclear for what that really entails.
         </p>            
            <p>As an individual, the GDPR is very useful for protecting yourself and your information from being collected to a massive degree. 
            In addition to this, during times where information is collected, 
            it needs to be behind strict security measures which include things such as firewalls and antivirus software.
            Breaking the law would also carry a big fine, that deters companies from breaking it.</p>
          <p>
           For companies on the other hand, the law is not nearly as helpful, for the fact that what is known as personalized ad revenue is a large part of their income.
         The law being unclear in some parts, in addition to carrying large fines, can lead to unjust enforcements of the GDPR law.</p>
