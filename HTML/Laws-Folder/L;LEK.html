          The Electronic Communications Act "Lagen om Elektronisk Kommunikation", shortened "LEK", is a very comprehensive law that regulates how one may use things such as radio and telecommunications networks
           A cookie is a small text file that websites can store on your computer or mobile phone and then use for specific purposes. These can be useful for login information,
            shopping cart or to ensure that the same person can not vote several times one something like a poll.
           </p>
           <p>
         However, cookies can be used for less innocent purposes with more malicious intent,
          like saving your search history which can then be used for targeted advertising. This can be seen as an invasion of personal integrity,
           and therefore it is important to be able to keep track of how websites use cookies. LEK means that websites must always inform the visitor about which cookies they use and for what purpose.
            The user must then have the opportunity to choose which cookies the site then uses. Paying proper attention should always be done to know exactly what a website asks of you.
           <p>
         If you surf the internet, the ideal is to read through all the cookies used for the specific website you enter, but some shortcuts can be taken.
          One may for example choose on their browser to automatically block third-party cookies, as these usually come from advertising companies.
           As long as a user stays informed about the use of cookies and the web pages follow the rules
            guidelines,the privacy of you will be protected while the practical use of cookies can be taken advantage of.
