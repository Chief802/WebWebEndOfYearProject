          Copyright, or "Upphpvsr√§tt", is a legal concept which means that the person who created a work has the right to decide for themselves who may use it and how. This is extremely important to take into account when using things such video and pictures on the internet,
 as you can suffer large fines or even imprisonment if you are not careful and use other people's work without their permission.
  </p>
  <p>
The principle in copyright is that a person who has created something that always must have exclusive rights.
It's not necessaryto apply for this protection that comes with the copyright law. The law is automatically assigned to all works of art that are published in all cases.
The original creator can choose who has access to and can view copies of the work, as well as who can use it,
especially when published online.
  </p>
  <p>
Copyright gives the creator mainly two kinds of rights: non-profit law and economic law.
 Non-profit right means that the creator has the right to be attributed to the author
  and that the work may not be used in a way that is offensive to the author. This essentially means the creator of the work must be attributed in a respectful manner.
   Financial law gives the creator the right to receive financial compensation for commercial use of the work.
    Simply put, this means if you ask to use a creator's work, then they can either sell you the permit or give it to you for free.
     The creator maya also sell, or give their financial right to another person or company if they so wish.
